                     <!-- Video annotation is based on the concept of image annotation. For video annotation, features are manually labeled on every video frame (image) to train a machine learning model for video detection. Hence, the dataset for a video detection model is composed of images for the individual video frames.
                  </p>

                  <p style="color: black; text-align: justify; line-height: 22px;">
                     It is the process of labeling or tagging video clips which are used for training computer vision models to detect or identify objects. Unlike image annotation, video annotation involves annotating objects on a frame-by-frame basis to make them recognizable for machine learning models.
                    <br><br>
                    High-quality video annotation generates ground truth datasets for optimal machine learning functionality. There are numerous deep learning applications for video annotation across industries including self-driving cars, medical AI, and geospatial technology. -->
