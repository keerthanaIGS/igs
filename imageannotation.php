    							<!--<b>What are the different processes of image annotation?</b><br>-->
								Understanding images is the key to creating <b>machine learning models</b> that can easily learn and understand the real world. Our <b>image annotation service </b>leads to better performing models. <br><br>

								One of the most popular uses of machine learning today is <b>computer vision</b>. It's in your phone camera and used to identify everything from people to text in photos. We know this is a crowded field, and we want to help. That's why our <b>annotation experts </b>are on hand to discuss how technology can make your business better.  <br><br>

								With our <b>Image Annotation Service</b>, you can easily train your own <b>AI models</b> to more accurately recognize the objects captured in images. To provide an accurate <b>dataset</b> for <b>computer vision projects, data scientists</b> and <b>ML engineers</b> need to <b>label images</b>. <br><br>

    							<!-- Image annotation plays a significant role in computer vision, the technology that allows computers 
    							to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos and to see and interpret visual information 
    							just like humans.
    							<br><br>
    							We need to create a novel labelled dataset for use in computer vision projects, data scientists and ML 
    							engineers have the choice between a variety of annotation types they can apply to images. 
    							Researchers will use an image markup tool to help with the actual labelling.  -->

    							Let’s compare and summarise the three common annotation types within computer vision:

    							In image classification, Our goal is to simply identify which objects and other properties exist 
    							in an image without localizing them within the image.
    							Image object detection, we go one step further to find the position (established by using bounding boxes) 
    							of individual objects within the image.
    
    							In image segmentation, Our goal is to recognize and understand what's in the image at the pixel level.
    							Every pixel in an image is assigned to at least one class, as opposed to object detection, where the bounding 
    							boxes of objects can overlap. This is also known as semantic segmentation.
    							<br><br>
    							For that we need to be acquainted with the different image annotation methods themselves.
        						Let’s analyse the most common image annotation techniques.

    							<b>1. Bounding Boxes</b><br>
        						Bounding boxes are one of the most commonly used types of image annotation in all of computer vision, 
        						thanks in part to their versatility and simplicity. Bounding boxes enclose objects and assist the computer
        						vision network in locating objects of interest.

    							<b>2. Polygonal Segmentation</b><br>
        						Another type of image annotation is polygonal segmentation, and the theory behind it 
        						is just an extension of the theory behind bounding boxes. Polygonal segmentation tells a 
        						computer vision system where to look for an object, but thanks to using complex polygons
        						and not simply a box, the object’s location and boundaries can be determined with much greater accuracy.

    							<b>3. Line Annotation</b><br>
        						Line annotation involves the creation of lines and splines, which are used primarily to delineate 
        						boundaries between one part of an image and another. Line annotation is used when a region that needs
        						to be annotated can be conceived of as a boundary, but it is too small or thin for a bounding box or 
        						other type of annotation to make sense.

    							<b>4.Landmark Annotation</b><br>
        						A fourth type of image annotation for computer vision systems is landmark annotation, sometimes 
        						referred to as dot annotation, owing to the fact that it involves the creation of dots/points across an image. 
        						Just a few dots can be used to label objects in images containing many small objects, but it is common for 
        						many dots to be joined together to represent the outline or skeleton of an object.

    							<b>5. 3D Cuboids</b><br>
        						3D cuboids are a powerful type of image annotation, similar to bounding boxes in that they distinguish 
        						where a classifier should look for objects. However, 3D cuboids have depth in addition to height and width.

    						<p style="color: black;">
    							<b>6. Semantic Segmentation</b><br>
        						Semantic segmentation is a form of image annotation that involves separating an image into different
        						regions, assigning a label to every pixel in an image. Regions of an image that carry different semantic 
        						meanings/definitions are considered separate from other regions. For example, one portion of an image
        						could be “sky”, while another could be “grass”. The key idea is that regions are defined based on semantic 
        						information, and that the image classifier gives a label to every pixel that comprises that region.
