                    <!-- Text annotation is identifying and labeling sentences with additional information or metadata to define 
                    the characteristics of sentences. This information could be highlighting parts of speech in a sentence, 
                    grammar syntax, keywords, phrases, emotions, sarcasm, sentiments and more depending on the scope of a project. 
                    Machine learning modules are fed with such AI training data, where they learn diverse aspects of sentences, 
                    sentence formation, and more to understand human conversations better. -->
                    Textual annotations should be done with well-defined rules. We provide a well-defined process to annotate and deliver strategic insights through our extensive domain knowledge. Data, especially high-quality, clean, <b>human-labelled data</b>, is the heart of any NLP application, particularly for <b>LLM training data</b>. We specialize in providing the essential <b>AI training datasets </b> needed for developing robust machine learning models.

                    <b>Types of Text Annotation</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Annotations for text include a wide range of types, such as sentiment, intent, semantic, and relationship. 
                    These options are available across a wide array of human languages.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Sentiment Annotation</b><br>
                    Sentiment annotation evaluates attitudes and emotions behind a text by labeling that text as positive, negative, or neutral.<br><br>
                    <b>Intent Annotation</b><br>
                    Intent annotation analyzes the need or desire behind a text, classifying it into several categories, such as request, command, or confirmation.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Semantic Annotation</b><br>
                    Semantic annotation attaches various tags to text that reference concepts and entities, such as people, places, or topics.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Relationship Annotation</b><br>
                    Relationship annotation seeks to draw various relationships between different parts of your document. 
                    Typical tasks include dependency resolution and coreference resolution. The type of project and associated 
                    use cases will determine which text annotation technique should be selected.
